## Gaussian Process Regression (April 10, 2024)
1. [Gaussian Process Regression](https://github.com/srossi93/asi-labs/blob/master/lab_week2-public/Gaussian_Process_Regression.ipynb)

**Note:** To run the file you may need to have jax library: https://pypi.org/project/jax/

One of these commands may help:
```
pip install jax
pip install -U "jax[cpu]"
pip install jaxlib 
```
If you're still struggling to import the library, you may need to create a new environment (kernel) and install the jax library there.
